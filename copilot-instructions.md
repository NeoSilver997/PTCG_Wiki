# PTCG_Wiki - Copilot Instructions

## Project Purpose
This folder is for generating and experimenting with static HTML mock pages using different LLMs (Large Language Models). Each subfolder (e.g., GPT-4.1) contains a set of mock pages generated by a specific LLM or prompt style.

## Design Principle
- **All mock pages must be based on the design, layout, and interactive functions of the root folder's (PTCG_Wiki/) base HTML files.**
- When creating or expanding a page, always start from the most feature-rich, interactive, and visually detailed version in the root folder (e.g., card-detail.html).
- You may expand, split, or adapt the base design to fit new features, but do not remove core UI/UX or interactive elements present in the base version.
- Use consistent navigation, sticky headers, card image handling, variant selection, price comparison, tabbed content, evolution chain, and related card sections as in the base files.
- All new mockups in subfolders should reference images, CSS, and scripts in a way that works for static preview (relative paths, demo data, etc.).

## Workflow
1. When generating a new mock page, copy the structure and interactive features from the root folder's corresponding base file.
2. Expand or split the page as needed for the new use case, but keep the base functionality and style.
3. Place the new or modified page in the appropriate LLM subfolder (e.g., GPT-4.1/).
4. Document any major design or function changes in a comment at the top of the new file.

## Example
- If creating GPT-4.1/card-detail.html, start from PTCG_Wiki/card-detail.html, then adapt or expand for the new mock/demo purpose.

## Notes
- This folder is for static mockup and UI/UX prototyping only. No backend or dynamic data is required.
- Use Tailwind CSS and Google Fonts as in the base files.
